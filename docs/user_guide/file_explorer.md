## Global Key Mappings

There're two global key mappings for easier working with neo-tree:

- `<Leader>nt` ðŸ„½ - Toggle file explorer by `:Neotree`.
- `<Leader>nf` ðŸ„½ - Find/locate current file in file explorer by `:Neotree reveal`.

## Local Key Mappings

Neo-tree also provide a lot of buffer-local key mappings (which only works inside the neo-tree buffer), we keep most of them by default, only a few are changed:

### Added Keys

- `l` ðŸ„½ - Open file/directory.
- `h` ðŸ„½ - Close directory.
- `<C-f>` ðŸ„½ - Fuzzy finder.
- `[c`/`]c` ðŸ„½ - Navigate to previous(ðŸ‘†)/next(ðŸ‘‡) git changes.
