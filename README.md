# lin.nvim : Lin Rongbin's Neovim Distribution

> Leave Vim behind, this is the next generation of [lin.vim](https://github.com/linrongbin16/lin.vim).

lin.nvim is a highly configured [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) distribution
integrated with tons of utilities for development, inspired by [spf13-vim](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim).

## Introduction

Aim to be out-of-box, IDE-like editing experience, performant, lightweight and
friendly to most Neovim users. Focus on and only on editing, no compiling/packaging/debugging.

The ultra config to solve these issues:

- Duplicate installation on different OS and machines? All done by one-line
  command (not on Windows for now), same behaviors on all platforms.
- Time-costing configurations? All configs follow community best practice, vim
  trandition and most popular editors (just like [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
- Lack of IDE-like editing features (auto-complete, diagnostics, auto-format,
  lint)? [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig),
  [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp),
  [mason.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim),
  [null-ls.nvim](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim),
  [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) and a bunch of language plugins
  and extensions are embeded.
- Naive UI (lack of IDE-like UI)? - File explorer, git status, opened buffers,
  icons and most popular colorschemes integrated (again, just like vscode).
- How to use in the vim way? - Most popular vim editing enhancement plugins
  embeded, and well cooperated for best user experience and performance.
